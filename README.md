# Grid Layout Exercise

Clone this repository, download the images and try to clone them by coding: one display for a mobile phone device and another one for a desktop (let's say the media query breakpoint is going to be 768px).

Don't pay attention to the content, font-family, colors or background-colors. Just focus on the grid.

Remember there are thousand ways to achieve this challenge.

Just in case you get stuck, take a look to the index and style files.

Good luck!
